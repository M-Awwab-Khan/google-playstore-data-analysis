Have you ever thought about building your own an iOS or Android app? If so, then you probably have wondered about how things work in the app stores. Today we'll replicate some of the app store analytics provided by companies like App Annie or Sensor Tower that helps inform development and app marketing strategies for many companies. This stuff is BIG business!



- In this project, I have compared thousands of apps in the Google Play Store so that we can gain insight into:
- How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are
- Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity
- How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free
- How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app
- Which paid apps have had the highest revenue
- How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue
